# verilog-based-flip-flops-and-counter and multiplier
1. Write the verilog module of a D flip-flop (module name should be dff_syn) with synchronous set,
reset and enable pin? Simulate (testbench name should be test_dff_syn ) the design to verify the
truth table of the proposed design. 

2. Write the verilog module of a S-R flip-flop (module name should be SR_FLIP) and verify the
truth table of the design through simulation (testbench name should be test_SR_FLIP).

3. Use previously designed S-R flip flop (in Que. 2) and write the verilog module (module name
should be SR_to_JK) to convert the flip-flop to J-K flip flop? Simulate (test bench name should
be test_SR_to_JK) the converted J-K flip-flop to verify the truth table of J-K flip-flop. 

4. Use the above converted J-K flip-flop (in Que. 3) to design the verilog module of a mod-10 up
and down counter (module name should be UP_DOWN_WITH_SR_to_JK) and verify the
Design through simulation (test bench name should be (test_UP_DOWN_WITH_SR_to_JK).

5. What do you mean by floating point representation in a number system? Elaborate, the digital
design could be used for the multiplication of two floating point numbers represented in 32 bit
IEEE Standard 754 floating point format ? Write a verilog module of the name mult_FP32 that
multiplies the two 32-bit floating point numbers, ranging from -1 to 1. Simulate at least 05
distinct multiplication problems with the designed multiplier with a testbench named
"test_mult_FP32" ?
